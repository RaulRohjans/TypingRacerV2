This is the second version of my typing racer game. This one is pretty similar to the first version I made but uses a different algorithm which makes it way more optimized than the first version. No matter the size of the text that you import, this one wont lag, what might happen if the text is too big is it will take a while to load.
Although this version is also complete, it could use some more quality of life features (like changing the time or having the ability to restart without having to import another text file) and a more appealing design, as the current one is quite boring looking.
